### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare data

### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three cities in the United States
 (Chicago, New York City, and Washington). I wrote code to import the data and answer the questions about it by computing
 descriptive statistics. I wrote a script that takes in user input to create an interactive experience in the workspace
to present these statistics.
